# Advent Of Code

## Day 1
#### Part 1
Simply finding numeric character then return. 
#### Part 2
- Regular Expression: Learn about built-in regex function `preg_match` and `preg_match_all` in PHP  
- Costing me a lot of time to find out edge cases like 'oneightnine', and `preg_match` only catches the first occurrence.
- Creating a class to use, which might be nice, maybe.
